Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)
====================================

### Overview
Build a data pipeline that handles both structured and unstructured data, processes it, and allows querying via embeddings for a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) use case. The solution should be well-documented and optimized for performance and scalability.

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Provide a Dataset**: 
  - Include a mix of structured (e.g., CSV) and unstructured data (e.g., JSON, text files).
- **Task**: 
  - Build a pipeline to load the dataset into a database of your choice.
  - Ensure the database schema is optimized for querying.
  
### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Handle potential noise, missing values, and unstructured text (e.g., text cleaning, parsing nested JSON).
- **Task**: 
  - Demonstrate preprocessing techniques to optimize data for efficient storage and retrieval.

### 3. Vectorization
- **Task**: 
  - Use a pre-trained language model or embeddings model to convert unstructured text into embeddings.
  - Store these embeddings in a vector storage solution of your choice.
  - Ensure the pipeline can handle batch processing of larger datasets.

### 4. Query and Retrieve
- **API or Script**: 
  - Build a simple API or script for querying based on a text prompt.
  - Retrieve similar embeddings from the vector store and return the corresponding records from the database.
- **RAG Use Case**: 
  - Implement a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) use case where the retrieved data is used to generate a summary or response based on the query.

### 5. Documentation
- **Task**: 
  - Document your code and explain your design choices.
  - Highlight any trade-offs you made (e.g., schema design, vector storage choice).

### 6. Bonus (Optional)
- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  - Implement monitoring or logging for the data pipeline to track the data flow and identify bottlenecks.
- **Scalability**: 
  - Optimize the pipeline for scalability, such as handling larger files or parallel processing.
